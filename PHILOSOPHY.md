Eels up inside ya
Findin an entrance where they can
Eels up inside ya
Findin an entrance where they can

Boring through your mind, through your tummy, through your anus, eels!

Eels!

Eels (x14)

Give it up now!

Eels!

Eels, eels, give it up now!
Eels, eels, give it up now!

I was obselete
I couldn't hear the beat
Staggerin about on me old mans feet
I had one foot in the grave
But now I'm nu rave!
But now I'm nu rave!

It's a mash up!
Pie and mash up!

Elements of the past
And elements of the future
Comin atcha
I'm the hitcher
Let me put you in the picture!

Eels up inside ya
Findin an entrance where they can
Eels up inside ya
Findin an entrance where they can

Elements of the past and the future combining to make something not quite as good as either...
