# Component JSON Files

These 362 JSON files were created by Brett Whitty as part of the `dev-component` project (2017), which converted Ergatis component XML configurations to JSON format for easier programmatic analysis.

**Source:** `~/repos/eels/ergatis-eels-devel/dev-component/`

**Original work:** Brett Whitty, 2017

These files represent a complete conversion of the Ergatis component library from XML to structured JSON, preserving:
- Component configuration parameters
- Tool execution chains
- Iterator patterns
- Input/output specifications
- Converter usage

This conversion work predates the EELS project and is incorporated here as foundational data for knowledge extraction.
