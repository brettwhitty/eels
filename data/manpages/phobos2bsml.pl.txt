SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: phobos2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/somefile.out
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
             [ --project=aa1 ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input .out file from a Phobos search.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, or overwritten)

       --project,-p
           Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.  Defaults to whatever the prefix of the
           input file is (i.e. spntigr4.assembly.1.1 would be spntigr4).

       --id_repository,-r
           Required for creating feature identifiers.  Each project should have
           its own id_repository directory - use the full path to it here.

       --help,-h

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from an phobos run into BSML.

INPUT
       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are created for each result element.  They are globally
       unique, but will need to be replaced before any database insertion.
