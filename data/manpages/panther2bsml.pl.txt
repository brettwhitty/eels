DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the raw output from a panther search into BSML.

INPUT
       The input file passed to this script must be a raw alignment file generated by panther.  Define the input file using the --input option.

       Illegal characters will be removed from the IDs for the query sequence and subject hit if necessary to create legal XML id names.  For each element, the original, unmodified
       name will be stored in the "title" attribute of the Sequence element.  You should make sure that your ids don't begin with a number.  This script will successfully create a BSML
       document regardless of your ID names, but the resulting document may not pass DTD validation.

OUTPUT
       The BSML file to be created is defined using the --output option.  If the file already exists it will be overwritten.
