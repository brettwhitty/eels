DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a glimmer3 search into BSML.

INPUT
       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.  The regular output of glimmer3 looks like this:

       >zma1.assembly.5808 orf00001   319296      174  +1     3.95 orf00002      430      969  +1     3.91 orf00003     1197     1051  -1    12.79 orf00004     1258     1368  +1
       6.95 orf00005     1541     1681  +2     8.58 orf00007     1889     1755  -3    11.14 orf00008     2014     1874  -2     0.37 orf00009     2153     2359  +2    48.95

       Where the columns from left to right contain: orf_id   start_position   end_position   reading_frame   "raw"_score

       A few things to note: - glimmer3 will find genes spanning the end/beginning of the given sequence, as if dealing with a circular molecule (unless given the -l or --linear
       option).  These are dealt with in bsml by converting the start_pos into a coordinate to the left of the origin (a negative number).  - The raw_score in the .predict file may be
       different than that found in the .details file, due to adjustments made for the PWM and start codon frequency.  This value from the .predict file can therefore be used to make
       direct comp- arisons between predictions.  - The ranges given by glimmer3 differ from those given by glimmer2 because they now include the stop codon.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are
       created for each result element.  They are only unique to the document, and will need to be replaced before any database insertion.

       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.
