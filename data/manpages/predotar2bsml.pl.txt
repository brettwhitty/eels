NAME
       predotar2bsml.pl - convert predotar output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: predotar2bsml.pl --input=/path/to/predotar_file --output=/path/to/output.bsml

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file file from a predotar run.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from predotar into BSML.

INPUT
       predotar can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.  predotar output using 'p' option for
       plant sequence looks like:

       Predotar v. 1.03 using plant predictors initializing predictors...  initializing sequence formats...  reading temp_multi format assumed to be FastA Seq     Mit     Plast   ER
       None    Prediction NCAPP1  0.01    0.01    0.98    0.02    ER two     0.59    0.05    0.00    0.39    mitochondrial three   Discarding three: no terminal Met finished reading
       temp_multi predicted 2 sequences out of 3

       or using 'a' for animal/fungi:

       Predotar v. 1.03 using animal/fungal predictors initializing predictors...  initializing sequence formats...  reading temp_multi format assumed to be FastA Seq     Mit     ER
       None    Prediction NCAPP1  0.02    0.99    0.01    ER two     0.63    0.01    0.36    mitochondrial three   Discarding three: no terminal Met finished reading temp_multi
       predicted 2 sequences out of 3

       Output from both analysis types are supported. Discarded sequences are ignored.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

       Weak predictions are qualified with the term 'possibly' (eg: 'possibly ER').  By default, weak predictions and strong predictions will be treated as equally acceptable by the
       parser. To modify this behaviour and reject weak predictions, use the option --strict.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.
