NAME
       fuzznuc2bsml.pl - convert fuzznuc raw output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: fuzznuc2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/somefile.hmmpfam.raw
               --output=/path/to/somefile.hmmpfam.bsml
               --fasta_input=/path/to/hmmpfam/input.fsa
               --gzip_output=1
               --log=/path/to/some.log
               --debug=4
               --help
             ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input raw alignment file from an hmmpfam search.

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file

       --fasta_input,-f
           Optional.  If included, will make a seq data import element and include the
           defline with the sequences.

       --gzip_output,-g
           Optional.  If given a non-zero value, will compress the output and give the output
           file a .gz extension.  If the file already contains one, it won't add another.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --help,-h

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the raw alignment output from an hmmpfam search into BSML.

INPUT
       The input file passed to this script must be a raw alignment file generated by hmmpfam.  Define the input file using the --input option.

       Illegal characters will be removed from the IDs for the query sequence and subject hit if necessary to create legal XML id names.  For each element, the original, unmodified
       name will be stored in the "title" attribute of the Sequence element.  You should make sure that your ids don't begin with a number.  This script will successfully create a BSML
       document regardless of your ID names, but the resulting document may not pass DTD validation.

OUTPUT
       The BSML file to be created is defined using the --output option.  If the file already exists it will be overwritten.

       Because the hmmpfam executable is used to perform a variety of searches, including hmmsmart and hmmtigr, the user may pass a value using --search_method, which will create the
       appropriate titles in the BSML Analysis element.  If not passed, the default 'hmmpfam' is used.
