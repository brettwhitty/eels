NAME
       tRNAscan-SE2bsml.pl - convert tRNAcan-SE output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: tRNAscan-SE2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/tRNAscanfile
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
               --fasta_input=/path/to/fastafile
               --id_repository=/path/to/id_repository
               --project=aa1
               [ --gzip_output=1
                 --log=/path/to/logfile
                 --debug=3
               ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file file from a tRNAscan-SE search.

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --fasta_input,-a
           The input file that was used as input for the tRNAscan-SE run

       --id_repository,-r
           Path to the project's id repository

       --gzip_output,-g
           Optional. A non-zero value will make compressed output.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --project,-p
           Required. Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.
           If 'aa1' is passed, repeat feature IDs created are like aa1.repeat_region.4231.1
           If 'parse' is passed, will parse from already present ids.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a tRNAscan-SE search into BSML.

INPUT
       tRNAscan-SE can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.  Usual tRNAscan-SE output looks
       like:

           Sequence                tRNA            Bounds          tRNA    Anti    Intron Bounds   Cove
           Name            tRNA #  Begin           End             Type    Codon   Begin   End     Score
           --------        ------  ----            ------          ----    -----   -----   ----    ------
           51595           1       101064          101137          Asn     GTT     0       0       82.29
           51595           2       705796          705868          Ala     AGC     0       0       68.12
           ...
           51595           13      3488675         3488743         Pseudo  GTA     0       0       22.49
           51595           14      3493468         3493555         Ser     GCT     3493506 3493513 40.19

       You can elimate the headers in the original tRNAscan-SE output file by running tRNAscan-SE using the -b option.  If they are present, they should be ignored by this script.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are
       created for each result element.  They are only unique to the document, and will need to be replaced before any database insertion.

       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.  The current output elements from tRNAscan-SE that are not represented in the BSML file are:

           tRNA type
           Anti Codon
           Cove Score

       These need to be included later.
