NAME
       fasta2bsml.pl - convert fasta files to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE:  fasta2bsml.pl
               --fasta_input=/path/to/fileORdir | --fasta_list=/path/to/file
               --format=multi|single
               --output=/path/to/somefile.fsa   | /path/to/somedir
             [ --class=assembly
               --output_list=/path/to/somefile.list
               --output_subdir_size=20000
               --output_subdir_prefix='somename'
               --debug=debug_level
               --log=log_file
             ]

OPTIONS
       --class,-c
           Sets the class attribute of each Sequence element created.  Default = assembly.

       --fasta_input,-i
           Input files or folders.  Can be a comma-separated list of mixed input types.

       --fasta_list,-s
           Text file that is a list of input files and/or folders.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --format,-f
           Format.  'multi' (default) writes all sequences to a multi-entry bsml file, and 'single' writes each sequence in a separate file named like $id.bsml

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output file (if --format=multi) or directory (if --format=single)

       --output_list,-u
           Optional.  If passed, will create a list file containing the path to each of the
           files created.

       --output_subdir_size,-z
           Optional.  Number of files to create within each output subdirectory.

       --output_subdir_prefix,-x
           Optional.  Rather than just plain numberical names (N), output subdirectories will
           be named like "prefixN" if you pass a prefix with this.

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert fasta to BSML.  The input is meant to be as flexible as possible and is described below.  The output can be either a single file with multiple
       <Sequence> entries, or separate files for each entry.

INPUT
       Input can be either a single file, a directory of files, or a list.  A list is a text file containing a list of either files or directories, one on each line.

       Any individual fasta file can have a single entry or multiple entries.  This script will separate them as needed.

       The --fasta_input option is used to pass files or directories.  The following example passes a single fasta file:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input=/foo/bar/dnaA.fna

       We can pass multiple files in a comma-separated list (use quotes):

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input="/foo/bar/dnaA.fna, /foo/bar/tonB.faa"

       If /foo/bar had many fasta files in it and we want to process them all, we could just do:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input=/foo/bar

       Also multiple directories are ok:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input="/foo/bar, /home/you"

       You can even mix directories and files:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input="/foo/bar/dnaA.fna, /home/you"

       Lists are useful if you have a specific set of files or directories to process.  If we have a file named, for example, '/foo/bar/neatstuff.list', which has contents like (the
       .list suffix is completely optional):

           /foo/bar/thingy1.fna
           /foo/bar/thingy2.faa
           ...
           /foo/bar/thingy1034.fsa

       You can pass this list to the script:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_list=/foo/bar/neatstuff.list

       If one of the lines in the list is a path to a directory rather than a file, each fasta file in that directory will be processed.  A list can contain paths to both files and
       directories such as:

           /foo/bar/thingy1.bsml
           /foo/bar/thingy2.bsml
           ...
           /foo/bar/thingy1034.bsml
           /home/you

       Finally, you can be really messy and mix input types and methods to process files, directories and lists all at the same time:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input="/foo/bar/dnaA.bsml, /home/you" --fasta_list=/home/you/some.list

       Once everything is evaluated down to the file-level, all will be skipped that don't have one of the following suffices: .fsa .faa .fna .fasta

OUTPUT
       The fasta format is limited in its data representation in the header.  Because of this, this script was written very generically to allow any sort of header.  In each <Sequence>
       element created, the attributes generated are length, title, and id.  (other attributes my be handled by default in BsmlBuilder).  The id is assumed to be the first part of the
       fasta header up to the initial whitespace.  So with this header:

           >gi46446716  putative chromosomal replication initiator protein, dnaA

       The 'id' attribute will be set to 'gi46446716'.  The 'title' attribute is set to the entire value of the fasta header, including the first word that became the id.

       Output is specified using the required --output and optional --format options.  By default the output will be a single file containing multiple sequences entries.  So:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input=/foo/bar --output=/home/you/seqs.bsml

       This would read all the fasta files in /foo/bar and write their sequences to the seqs.bsml file in /home/you in multi-entry format.  If you want each sequence to be output
       separately, you need to use the --format=single option:

           fasta2bsml.pl --fasta_input=/foo/bar --output=/home/you/data --format=single

       This would write each sequence to its own .bsml file into the /home/you/data directory.  Each file will be named using the id attribute of each sequence, like $id.fsa .
       --format=multi is the default and does not need to be passed explicitly.  Note that the only legal characters for the file name are in the set [ a-z A-Z 0-9 - _ . ].  Any other
       characters will be replaced with underscores.

       You can pass a path to the optional --output_list to create a text file containing the full paths to each of the BSML files created by this script.

       Two other optional arguments, --output_subdir_size and --output_subdir_prefix, can be used on input sets that are too large to write out to one directory.  This depends on the
       limitations of your file system, but you usually don't want 100,000 files written in the same directory.

       If you are going to create 95000 sequences, and use the following option:

           --output=/some/path
           --output_subdir_size=30000

       The following will be created:

           directory              file count
           ---------------------------------
           /some/path/0/          30000
           /some/path/1/          30000
           /some/path/2/          30000
           /some/path/3/           5000

       If you choose to create a list file (and you probably want to), it will contain these paths.

       You may not want the subdirectories to simply be numbers, as above, so you can use the --output_subdir_prefix option.  For example:

           --output=/some/path
           --output_subdir_size=30000
           --output_subdir_prefix=bsml

       The following will be created:

           directory              file count
           ---------------------------------
           /some/path/bsml0/     30000
           /some/path/bsml1/     30000
           /some/path/bsml2/     30000
           /some/path/bsml3/      5000
