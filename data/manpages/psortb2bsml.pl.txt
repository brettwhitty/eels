DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from psortb into BSML.

INPUT
       Pepstats can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script will support this.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.
