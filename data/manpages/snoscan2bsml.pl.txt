DESCRIPTION
       snoscan2bsml.pl will take an output file from snoscan, sorted or raw, and convert the format to BSML.

INPUT
       The input is defined with --input_file and should be an output file from the program snoscan.  For an example, see

       http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/snoscan/snoscanReadme.html

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option will be generated (this file should not exist already).  Temporary ID's will be created for each result
       element and are only unique to this document.

       Base positions are renumbered to start at zero and represent interbase numbering.
