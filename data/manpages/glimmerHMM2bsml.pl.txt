NAME
       glimmerHMM2bsml.pl - convert glimmerHMM output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: glimmerHMM2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/glimmerHMM.output.file
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
              [ --project=aa1 ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file file from a glimmerHMM scan.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --fasta_file,-f
           If passed, will create a Seq-data-import element referencing this
           path.

       --project,-p
           Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.  Defaults to 'unknown' if
           not passed.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a glimmerHMM search into BSML.

INPUT
       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.  The regular output of glimmerHMM looks like this:

           GlimmerHMM
           Sequence name: aa1.assembly.15595
           Sequence length: 73904 bp
           Sequence C+G%: 39.976185

           Predicted genes/exons

           Gene Exon Strand  Exon            Exon Range      Exon
              #    #         Type                           Length

              1    1  -  Initial        2522       2729      208

              2    1  +  Single         4309       4566      258

              3    1  +  Initial        6567       6594       28
              3    2  +  Internal      10892      10912       21

              4    1  +  Initial       15371      17356     1986
              4    2  +  Terminal      23748      23900      153

              5    1  -  Terminal      26294      26316       23

       Each element in BSML requires an id, and the Sequence stub created uses as its ID the value after the "Sequence name: " label above (up to the first whitespace.)

       All other header lines in the file are ignored.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are
       created for each result element.  They are only unique to the document, and will need to be replaced before any database insertion.

       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.
