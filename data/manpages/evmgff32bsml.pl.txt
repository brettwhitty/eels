OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input gff3 format file created by EVM.

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file name.

DESCRIPTION
       This script parses GFF output from EVM and writes it out as BSML suitable for import into CHADO DBs.

INPUT
       Current assumption is that input files are syntactically correct with respect to the GFF3 spec, and that they are encoding predicted gene features.

       The script could be extended to support writing BSML from GFF3 compliant files encoding other features.

OUTPUT
       Output will be BSML encoding the EVM predicted gene models.
