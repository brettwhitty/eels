NAME
       repeatmasker2bsml.pl - convert RepeatMasker output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: repeatmasker2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/somefile.out
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
             [ --project=aa1 ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input .out file from a RepeatMasker search.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, or overwritten)

       --project,-p
           Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.  Defaults to 'unknown' if
           not passed.

       --id_repository,-r
           Required for creating feature identifiers.  Each project should have
           its own id_repository directory - use the full path to it here.

       --help,-h

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a RepeatMasker search into BSML.

INPUT
       RepeatMasker can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.  It generates a few output files,
       but the space-delimited ".out" file is used here.  A usual RepeatMasker .out file looks like (wide-window):

              SW  perc perc perc  query                position in query           matching       repeat             position in repeat
           score  div. del. ins.  sequence               begin      end   (left)   repeat         class/family           begin  end   (left)

       The * at the end of some lines indicates an overlap with other predictions.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are created for each result element.  They are globally
       unique, but will need to be replaced before any database insertion.

       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.  The current output elements from RepeatFinder that are not represented in the BSML file are:

           perc_div
           perc_del
           perc_ins

       We can add these later if anyone thinks they are necessary.
