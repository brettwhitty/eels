           Input file file from a signalp run.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from SignalP into BSML.

INPUT
       SignalP can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.  Output file types from 'nn', 'hmm', or
       'nn+hmm' prediction methods are all supported and recognized automatically.

       EDIT:  As of SignalP 4.0, all predictions use the 'nn' (neural network) method, and the choices are 'best' and 'notm' (no transmembrane regions).

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.
