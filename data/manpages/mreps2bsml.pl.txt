DESCRIPTION

       Warning: symbols N in your sequence has been replaced randomly by {A,C,G,T}. This might have created artefact repetitions.

       The header rows should be ignored by this script.

       Not all columns described in the header are seperated by tabs.  The columns as described by the headers: 1) 1-based start 2) 1-based end 3) size of the entire repeat region 4)
       period - size of the repeat unit 5) exponent - number of repet units in the region 6) error rate - lower means more significant 7) repeat sequence, with spaces seperating units
       of the repeat

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are
       created for each result element.

       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.
