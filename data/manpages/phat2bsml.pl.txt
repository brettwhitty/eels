NAME
       phat2bsml.pl - convert phat GFF output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: phat2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/phat.output.file.gff
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
             [ --project=aa1 ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file from a phat scan.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --project,-p
           Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.  Defaults to 'unknown' if
           not passed.

       --command_id
           This is passed automatically by workflow and is used in creating unique
           feature IDs.  It represents the command ID of the phat2bsml step withing the
           phat workflow component.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a phat search into BSML.

INPUT
       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.  The regular output of phat looks like this:

           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     8194    8426    1.00    -       1       gene "Phat1" frame"1"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     10940   11067   0.35    -       0       gene "Phat1" frame"0"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     26248   26370   0.52    +       0       gene "Phat2" frame"0"

           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     29317   29539   0.99    +       1       gene "Phat2" frame"1"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     30204   30371   0.79    +       0       gene "Phat2" frame"2"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     33893   34008   0.60    +       0       gene "Phat3" frame"1"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     35857   36031   0.97    +       1       gene "Phat3" frame"1"

           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     51132   51354   1.00    +       1       gene "Phat3" frame"0"
           sma1.assembly.29055     FullPhat        CDS     54721   54870   0.97    +       0       gene "Phat3" frame"0"

       which has the general format of:

           <seqname> <source> <feature> <start> <end> <score> <strand> <frame> <group>

       This script currently assumes that the input GFF file only contains the output from the analysis of a single FASTA sequence.   The raw output files from phat are not currently
       used.

OUTPUT
       Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.  Terminal CDS predictions from phat contain the stop codon, so no adjustment to include it
       within the BSML output is made.
