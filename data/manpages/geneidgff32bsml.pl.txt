SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: geneidgff32bsml.pl
                  --input|-i
                  --output|-o
                  --project|-p
                  --id_repository|r
                  --help|-h

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input gff3 format file created by geneid.

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file name.

       --project,-p
           Project/database name used to create feature identifiers.

       --id_repository,r
           Path to the id repository for the named project.

       --help,-h
           This help documentation

DESCRIPTION
       This script parses GFF3 output from geneid and writes it out as BSML suitable for import into CHADO/legacy DBs.  Note that this was pretty much evmgff32bsml.pl but edited to not
       merge CDS records, allowing accurate representation of the exon structure when loaded with bsml2legacydb.pl

INPUT
       Current assumption is that input files are syntactically correct with respect to the GFF3 spec, and that they are encoding predicted gene features.

       The script could be extended to support writing BSML from GFF3 compliant files encoding other features.  (as it was for this!)

OUTPUT
       Output will be BSML encoding the geneid predicted gene models.
