           Path to intended log file.

DESCRIPTION
       This script parses GFF output from genewise and writes it out as BSML suitable for import into CHADO/legacy DBs.  Specifically, this 2bsml script is meant to accompany the
       genewise executable in the genewise_best_loc pipeline.  It expects the input fasta to contain the coordinates mapping it back to the larger genome molecule, as such is the way
       genewise_best_loc works.  It splits the genomic data into regions around previously described aat search hits, then uses those proteins and the respective regions they hit on as
       the input for genewise.  Because of this, we must stitch the hits back into the overall assemblies by adjusting the coords to compensate for the truncation of the sequence by
       the script 'prepare_for_genwise_best_loc.pl'.

INPUT
       Current assumption is that input files are syntactically correct with respect to the GFF spec, (at least as far as that produced by genewise with -gff goes) and that they are
       encoding predicted gene features.

OUTPUT
       Output will be BSML encoding the geneid predicted gene models.  By the time the data is in bsml, it is 'standalone' and no more tricks need be played with it.  It can be loaded
       by a standard loader like bsml2legacydb or bsml2chado.
