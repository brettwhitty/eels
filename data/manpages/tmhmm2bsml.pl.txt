NAME
       tmhmm2bsml.pl - convert TMHMM output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: tmhmm2bsml.pl --input=/path/to/tmhmm_file --output=/path/to/output.bsml --project=aa1 --fasta_input=/path/to/tmhmm/input.fsa --compress_bsml_output=0

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file file from a tmhmm run [long format only!].

       --project
           [OPTIONAL]
           The project (used for id making).
           Default: unknown

       --fasta_input
           The fasta file used as input to the tmhmm run.

       --compress_bsml_output
           Will create gzipped output

       --id_repository,-r
           Required for creating feature identifiers.  Each project should have
           its own id_repository directory - use the full path to it here.  This
           is used by the IdGenerator.pm module.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from TMHMM into BSML.

INPUT
       TMHMM can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

       If the file does not exist, the program will automatically search for a gzip'ed version (same filename, with the extension '.gz').  If a '.gz' version exists, will read in the
       gzip'ed file.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.
