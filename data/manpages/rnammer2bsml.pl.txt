NAME
       RNAmmer2bsml.pl - convert RNAmmer output to BSML

SYNOPSIS
       USAGE: RNAmmer2bsml.pl
               --input=/path/to/rnammerfile
               --output=/path/to/output.bsml
               --fasta_input=/path/to/fastafile
               --id_repository=/path/to/id_repository
               --project=aa1
               [ --gzip_output=1
                 --log=/path/to/logfile
                 --debug=3
               ]

OPTIONS
       --input,-i
           Input file file from a RNAmmer search.

       --output,-o
           Output BSML file (will be created, must not exist)

       --fasta_input,-a
           The input file that was used as input for the RNAmmer run

       --id_repository,-r
           Path to the project's id repository

       --gzip_output,-g
           Optional. A non-zero value will make compressed output.

       --debug,-d
           Debug level.  Use a large number to turn on verbose debugging.

       --project,-p
           Required. Project ID.  Used in creating feature ids.
           If 'aa1' is passed, repeat feature IDs created are like aa1.repeat_region.4231.1
           If 'parse' is passed, will parse from already present ids.

       --log,-l
           Log file

       --help,-h
           This help message

DESCRIPTION
       This script is used to convert the output from a RNAmmer search into BSML.

INPUT
       RNAmmer can be run using multiple input sequences simultaneously, and this script supports parsing single or multiple input result sets.  Usual RNAmmer output looks like:

        seqname    source       feature  start   end     score  +/-  frame  attribute
        ---------  -----------  -------  ------  ------  -----  ---  -----  ---------
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA       273038      273152  97.6     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA       520669      520783  95.3     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA        92664       92778  97.6     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA       280298      280412  97.6     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA       304453      304567  97.6     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA        33753       33867  97.6     +         .       5s_rRNA
        Contig520      RNAmmer-1.2      rRNA        87004       87118  94.6     +         .       5s_rRNA

       You can elimate the headers in the original RNAmmer output file by running RNAmmer using the -b option.  If they are present, they should be ignored by this script.

       You define the input file using the --input option.  This file does not need any special file extension.

OUTPUT
       After parsing the input file, a file specified by the --output option is created.  This script will fail if it already exists.  The file is created, and temporary IDs are
       created for each result element.  They are only unique to the document, and will need to be replaced before any database insertion.

       #Base positions from the input file are renumbered so that positions start at zero.  The #current output elements from RNAmmer that are not represented in the BSML file are:

         #  rRNA type
         #  Anti Codon
         #  Cove Score

       #These need to be included later.
