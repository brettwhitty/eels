   "description" : "It is a high-precision localization prediction method for bacterial proteins. It has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular localization (SCL) predictor. Â PSORTb version improved recall, higher proteome-scale prediction coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. It is the first SCL predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with atypical membrane/cell wall topologies.",
