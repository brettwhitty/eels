   "description" : "Tandem Repeats Finder. Find tandem repeats in DNA sequences without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. It uses the method of k-tuple matching to avoid the need for full scale alignment matrix computations. It requires no a priori knowledge of the pattern, pattern size or number of copies. There are no restrictions on the size of the repeats that can be detected. It determines a consensus pattern for the smallest repetitive unit in the tandem repeat."
