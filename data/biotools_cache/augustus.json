   "description" : "AUGUSTUS is a eukaryotic gene prediction tool. It can integrate evidence, e.g. from RNA-Seq, ESTs, proteomics, but can also predict genes ab initio. The PPX extension to AUGUSTUS can take a protein sequence multiple sequence alignment as input to find new members of the family in a genome. It can be run through a web interface (see https://bio.tools/webaugustus), or downloaded and run locally.",
