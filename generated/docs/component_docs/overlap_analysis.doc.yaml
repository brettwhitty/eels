  USAGE: create_list_file.pl
         [  --directory|d=/path/to/some/directory/
            --output_list|o=/path/output.list

            --include_gz|g ]
  
  =head1	OPTIONS
  
  B<--directory,-d>
  	Location of the directory to search.  No wild card characters should be
      used in the directory.

  =head1	DESCRIPTION
  
      This script will search a directory for file names containing the given
      regular expression.  By default, all .gz or .gzip extensions are stripped
      off.  Programs using these list files should know to search for .gz|.gzip
      versions.
  
      **Note: No wild card characters should be used in this option.
  
  =head1	INPUT
  
      There are no required options to the script and there isn't really any
      input.  See above for defaults.  
  
  =head1	OUTPUT
  
      The script will output a list of files that match the regular expression
      given by option --regex|-r. If no output file is given, this script will 
      print out to standard out.

  =head1   DESCRIPTION
  
  This script is used to record the parameters of an analysis into the BSML file that the
  analysis created.  This is done to ensure that each of the run-time settings for the
  analysis are recorded for informational purposes or to re-run the analysis.

  =head1 NAME
  
  overlap_analysis.pl - Analyzes overlaps and attempts to resolve them
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   USAGE: overlap_analysis.pl
         --input_file=/path/to/some/gene_describing.bsml
         --output=/path/to/output.bsml
         --rna_bsml=/path/to/file1.bsml,/path/to/bsml.list

         --help
       ]
  
  =head1 OPTIONS
  
  B<--input_file,-i>
      A gene describing bsml document.  Will parse out Feature elements.
  
  B<--output,-o>
      The output bsml file
  
  B<--rna_bsml,-r>
      Bsml describing RNA predictions/models.
  
      Can take in a comma separated list of bsml files or bsml lists.  Will determine the
      format of the file based on the extension (.bsml or .list). Can be gzipped
      and therefore contain .gz extension.
  
  B<--evidence_bsml,-e>
      Bsml that holds alignment evidence (Blast/Ber and HMM)
  
      Takes a comma separated list of bsml files or bsml lists. Will determine the
      format of the file based on the extension (.bsml or .list). Can be gzipped
      and therefore contain .gz extension.
  
  B<--flagged_overlaps_file,-f>
      Output file containing information about the overlaps that could not be resolved.
  
  B<--overlap_cutoff,-c>
      The maximum allowed overlap (in nucleotides). Default = 60 nucleotides.
  
  B<--input_sequence_class,-s>
      Optional. Default = assembly.  The class of the parent sequence type
  
  B<--log,-l>
      Logfile.
  
  B<--help,-h>
      Print this message
  
  =head1  DESCRIPTION
  
   Finds overlaps between genes and between genes and RNAs. Will try to resolve the overlap:
  
   1. If two genes overlap more than the cutoff
     a. And one gene does not have evidence (as determined by input evidence bsml),
        the gene with no evidence is removed.
     b. If both genes have evidence, a line is printed to the flagged_overlaps_file
     c. If both genes have no evidence, a line is printed to the flagged_overlaps file
   2. If a gene overlaps an RNA (with any overlap)
     a. Remove gene if it has no evidence
     b. Print to flagged_overlaps_file if gene has evidence
  
  =head1  INPUT
  
    --input_file:
       Should be a gene describing bsml document. Will parse out Feature[@class="gene"] elements
       and compare the Interval-loc coordinates with other genes/RNAs with the same parent
       Sequence (based on id).
  
    --rna_bsml:
       An RNA describing bsml document. Parses Feature[@class="gene"] and looks for overlaps
       with genes
  
    --evidence_bsml:
       Bsml files describing sequence alignments from blast, ber, and hmm components
  
  
  =head1 OUTPUT
  
    Will produce a bsml file much like that provided in the --input_file, only with some
    genes removed due to overlaps.
  
    The flagged_overlaps_file will contain information about unresolved overlaps in the
    following format:
  
      feature_id1  type1  left1  right1  feature_id2  type2  left2  right2
  
    Where type is either gene or RNA
