# Contributors & Authors

This document recognizes the individuals who contributed to the Ergatis workflow management system. Their work represents years of dedicated effort in bioinformatics software engineering, algorithm development, and collaboration with PhD-level curators to build production-quality genomics annotation pipelines.

## About This Project

Ergatis was developed primarily at **The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)** and later maintained at the **J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)** and the **Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS)** at the University of Maryland. The system represents institutional knowledge from high-throughput genome annotation, when standards and best practices were being actively developed.

The value of this codebase lies not just in the software itself, but in the **human expertise** encoded within it: the careful engineering, the domain knowledge from working biologists, and the iterative refinement based on real-world production use.

## Organizations

### The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)
**Rockville, Maryland (1992-2006)**

TIGR was a pioneering genomics research institute founded by J. Craig Venter. It was responsible for sequencing the first complete genome of a free-living organism (Haemophilus influenzae) and made major contributions to the Human Genome Project. TIGR merged with other organizations to form JCVI in 2006.

### J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)
**Rockville, Maryland & La Jolla, California (2006-present)**

Formed from the merger of TIGR, the Center for the Advancement of Genomics, and the Joint Technology Center. Continues genomics research and maintains bioinformatics infrastructure.

### Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS)
**University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland**

Established in 2007, IGS focuses on genomic research and has continued development and maintenance of Ergatis for production genomics annotation pipelines.

## Acknowledgments

This software represents the collective effort of bioinformatics engineers, computational biologists, and PhD-level curators who worked together to build production-quality genome annotation systems. The careful attention to:

- **Data standards** (BSML, Chado)
- **Software engineering practices** (modularity, reusability, documentation)
- **Domain knowledge** (biological semantics, coordinate systems, evidence weighting)
- **Production requirements** (parallelization, error handling, monitoring)

...reflects the professionalism and dedication of everyone involved.
